> Simple Movie Review App

### 🏠 [Homepage](/Movie)

## Install

```sh
npm i
```

## How to run the code

```sh
npm start
```

## Architecture
🎥 **FrontEnd**
* Material-Table for a simple Material-ui framework style
* Class functions 
* Simple Fetch for Movies Extraction (cant fetch directly since Cors Privacy)


💻 **BackEnd**
* Use Firebase to only save comments with titles of movies (for an easy and fast search besides saving all movie titles)
* Didnt save all movies from json , since its most likely a rank system, it can probably change from time to time and there would be no porblems with comments been saved
